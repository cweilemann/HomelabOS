# UnofficialDDNSnix

[UnofficialDDNSnix](https://github.com/velo/UnofficialDDNSnix) is a CentOS 6, Debian 6, and Debian 7 service which provides dynamic DNS for regular registrars. Instead of signing up with a dynamic DNS provider and creating a CNAME record at your registrar to point to your dynamic DNS (for example: homeserver.mydomain.com -> alfred1986.dynamicdnsprovider.info), UnofficialDDNS cuts out the middle man and creates A records directly.
